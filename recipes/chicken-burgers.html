    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Burger night can be as indulgent as you want—we’re all for indulgence!—but sometimes you want to satisfy your burger craving and still feel like you ate and served up a healthy meal, too.
         We’ve leaned into our spicier side for this chicken burger recipe, topping them with homemade candied jalapeños—easier to make than you’d think—and spicy Pepper Jack cheese.
          They’re healthy and unbelievably satisfying.
    </p><p>Yes, you’ll still be needing a million napkins on hand when you’re eating these, which is how we know we’ve made a great burger recipe.
          This is not the mystery-bird chicken sandwich you remember from the school cafeteria—and thank goodness for that.
     </p>
