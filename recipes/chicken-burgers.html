    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Burger night can be as indulgent as you want—we’re all for indulgence!—but sometimes you want to satisfy your burger craving and still feel like you ate and served up a healthy meal, too.
         We’ve leaned into our spicier side for this chicken burger recipe, topping them with homemade candied jalapeños—easier to make than you’d think—and spicy Pepper Jack cheese.
          They’re healthy and unbelievably satisfying.
    </p><p>Yes, you’ll still be needing a million napkins on hand when you’re eating these, which is how we know we’ve made a great burger recipe.
          This is not the mystery-bird chicken sandwich you remember from the school cafeteria—and thank goodness for that.
     </p>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
         <li>Make the candied jalapeños! This sounds fussy but only takes about 10 minutes, and the payoff is big! Also, you can make them ahead of time to use when you’re ready!
              They’ll keep in the fridge for three months, so one batch will last you all summer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the smashed avocado! Literally just smash an avocado! The lemon juice is mostly just to keep the avocado from browning. Plus it tastes good.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix up those ground chicken burger patties! Just like with our beloved meatballs,
             making burger patties benefits from a gentle touch—mix with your hands, and stop when things begin to come together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the basil mayo! You’ve already got fresh basil and garlic for the chicken burgers, might as well use some to make a yummy mayo to top them with!
             Use a microplane grater to grate the garlic—it’ll almost melt when you do—and it’ll mix easily into the mayo.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the chicken burgers! No rare burgers here, please—you want that chicken thoroughly cooked through. Top them with cheese after you flip ‘em,
             and then when the cheese is melty and the burgers are cooked through, it’ll be time to load them up and dig in!
        </li>
     </ol>
